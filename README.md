## Built with VueJS

A preface to the test:

I made this as a technical test for front end dev position at jakmall.com. I am using VueJs, Stylus, NPM, webpack for building the project.
I made the program as expected on the jakmall.com technical test questions for the front end dev. both in UI, and in functionality. I learned a lot of the questions given. and I hope to give the best of what I produce. thank you!
